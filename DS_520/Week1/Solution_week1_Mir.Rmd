This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Problem 1.169

# A) Solution:


```{r}

# EAR
mean = 60
# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz = .9772
# RDA
A = 75

# find z-value from p-value
z= round(qnorm(pz, lower.tail = TRUE),2)
print(paste("z score for RDA is", z))

sd = (A-mean)/z
print(paste("Standard deviation of the requirement distribution is",sd))


```

# B) Solution:

```{r}
ul = 2000
xmin = mean-sd*3
xmax = mean+sd*3
# Create a sequence of numbers between xmin and 2000 incrementing by 0.1
x <- seq(xmin, ul, by = .1)
xgap <- ifelse(x>xmax,2000, x)
# Choose the mean as 60 and standard deviation as 7.5.
y <- dnorm(x, mean, sd)

# Problem 1.171

# A) Solution:

```{r}
# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz5 = 0.05


# find z-value from p-value
z5= round(qnorm(pz5),2)
print(paste("z score for 5th percentile is", z5))

# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz50 = 0.50
# RDA
A50 = 79
# find z-value from p-value
z50= round(qnorm(pz50, lower.tail = TRUE),2)
print(paste("z score for 50th percentile is", z50))

# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz95 = 0.95

# find z-value from p-value
z95= round(qnorm(pz95, lower.tail = TRUE),2)
print(paste("z score for 95th percentile is", z95))
```

We know z = (x-mean)/sd

So, mean = x-(sd*z)

But, for 50th percentile, z is 0 as p(z<=0.00) = .50

So, mean = A50-(sd*0)

Finally, mean = A50

```{r}
mean = A50
print(paste("The value of mean is",mean))

A95 = 142
sd = (A95-mean)/z95
print(paste("The value of standard deviation is",sd))

```

# B) Solution:

```{r}
ul = 2000
xmin = mean-sd*3
xmax = mean+sd*3
# Create a sequence of numbers between xmin and 2000 incrementing by 0.1
x <- seq(xmin, ul, by = .1)
xgap <- ifelse(x>xmax,2000, x)
# Choose the mean as 60 and standard deviation as 7.5.
y <- dnorm(x, mean, sd)
par(bty="n") # deleting the box
gap.plot(xgap,y, gap=c(200,1970), gap.axis="x", pch=16,
         col="blue", ylim=range(y),
         xtics=c(seq(-40, 200, by = 10),seq(1970, 2010, by = 10)), 
         xticlab=c(seq(-40, 200, by = 10),seq(1970, 2010, by = 10)), xlab = 'mg/d', 
         ylab ='', main="Distribution of Vitamin C Consumption for Female")
abline(v=mean, col="red")    #add new mean line
abline(v=60, col="purple")    # add old mean line
abline(v=75, col="violet")    # add RDA line
abline(v=seq(200,1970,100), col="white")  # hiding vertical lines
axis.break(1,200,style="slash")               # plotting slashes for breakpoints
legend(140, .01, legend=c("New mean", "Old mean", "RDA"),
       col=c("red", "purple", "violet"), lty=1:1, cex=0.8)

```

# C) Solution:

*As per the new graph, we can see that the new mean (79) is more than the previously estimated mean (60) and the new mean (79) which is at 50th percentile is also more than the RDA (75). So we can confidently say that majority of the female population consumes more vitamin C than the RDA on a daily basis.*

# Problem 1.172

# A) Solution:

```{r}
# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz5 = 0.05


# find z-value from p-value
z5= round(qnorm(pz5),2)
print(paste("z score for 5th percentile is", z5))

# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz50 = 0.50
# RDA
A50 = 114
# find z-value from p-value
z50= round(qnorm(pz50, lower.tail = TRUE),2)
print(paste("z score for 50th percentile is", z50))

# percent of RDA (p-value)
pz95 = 0.95

# find z-value from p-value
z95= round(qnorm(pz95, lower.tail = TRUE),2)
print(paste("z score for 95th percentile is", z95))
```

We know z = (x-mean)/sd

So, mean = x - (sd*z)

But, for 50th percentile, z is 0 as p(z<=0.00) = .50 

So, mean  = A50-(sd*0) 

Finally, mean = A50

```{r}
mean = A50 
print(paste("The value of mean is",mean))

A95 = 217
sd = (A95-mean)/z95
print(paste("The value of standard deviation is",sd))
```

# B) Solution:

```{r}
ul = 2000
xmin = mean-sd*3
xmax = mean+sd*3
# Create a sequence of numbers between xmin and 2000 incrementing by 0.1
x <- seq(xmin, ul, by = .1)
xgap <- ifelse(x>xmax,2000, x)
# Choose the mean as 60 and standard deviation as 7.5.
y <- dnorm(x, mean, sd)
par(bty="n") # deleting the box
gap.plot(xgap,y, gap=c(330,1970), gap.axis="x", pch=16,
         col="blue", ylim=range(y),
         xtics=c(seq(-80, 330, by = 10),seq(1970, 2010, by = 10)), 
         xticlab=c(seq(-80, 330, by = 10),seq(1970, 2010, by = 10)), xlab = 'mg/d', 
         ylab ='', main="Distribution of Vitamin C Consumption for Male")
abline(v=mean, col="red")    #add new mean line
abline(v=75, col="purple")    # add old mean line
abline(v=90, col="violet")    # add RDA line
abline(v=seq(330,1970,100), col="white")  # hiding vertical lines
axis.break(1,330,style="slash")               # plotting slashes for breakpoints
legend(240, .005, legend=c("New mean", "Old mean", "RDA"),
       col=c("red", "purple", "violet"), lty=1:1, cex=0.8)
```

# C) Solution:

*As per the new graph, we can see that the new mean (114) is more than the previously estimated mean (75) and the new mean (114) which is at 50th percentile is also more than the RDA (90). So we can confidently say that majority of the male population consumes more vitamin C than the RDA on a daily basis.*

# Problem 1.176

# A) Solution:

For third graders' current scores:

μ=70

σ=10

  z = (x-μ)/σ

=>z = (x-70)/10 .....(1)

For desired score

μ=100

σ=20

so X-new =z*σ +μ

         =[(x-70)/10]*20 +100 ......(from 1)

         =2x-140+100

         =2x-40

So, a=-40 and b=2

# B) Solution:

For six graders' current scores:

μ=80

σ=11

  z = (x-μ)/σ

=>z = (x-80)/11 .....(1)

For desired score

μ=100

σ=20

so X-new =z*σ +μ

         =[(x-80)/11]*20 +100 ......(from 1)

         =(20x-1600+1100)/11
         
         =(20x-500)/11

         =1.82x-45.45

So, a=-45.45 and b=1.82

# C) Solution:

David’s transformed score =-40+2*72=104

Nancy's transformed score = -45.45+1.82*78=96.51

David Scores higher as his standardized transformed score is higher.

# D) Solution:

For both third and six graders standardized scoring less than 75 as they have the same distribution:

```{r}
mean = 100
sd = 20
x = 75
z = (x-mean)/sd
z
pz = pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE)
print(paste("Percent value is", round(pz*100,2),"%"))

```

For non-standardized scoring:

```{r}
# for third graders
mean = 70
sd = 10
x = 75
z = (x-mean)/sd
z
pz = pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE)
print(paste("Percent value of third graders is", round(pz*100,2),"%"))

```

```{r}
# for sixth graders
mean = 80
sd = 11
x = 75
z = (x-mean)/sd
z
pz = pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE)
print(paste("Percent value of sixth graders is", round(pz*100,2),"%"))
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## A) Solution:


### Script for generating tree diagram (Reference: https://datakwery.com/project/tree/):
```{r}
prob_data <- df %>%  mutate(tree_level = str_count(string = pathString, pattern = "/") + 1,
         tree_group = str_replace(string = pathString, pattern = "/.*", replacement = ""),
         node_type = "decision_node"
  )

max_tree_level <- max(prob_data$tree_level, na.rm = T) 
```


```{r}
parent_lookup <- prob_data %>% distinct(pathString, prob) # get distinct probabilities to facilitate finding parent node probability

for (i in 1:(max_tree_level -  1)) { # loop through all tree layers to get all immidiate parent probabilities (to calculate cumulative prob)
  
  names(parent_lookup)[1] <-paste0("parent",i)
  names(parent_lookup)[2] <-paste0("parent_prob",i)
  
  for (j in 1:i) {
    
    if (j == 1)  prob_data[[paste0("parent",i)]] <- sub("/[^/]+$", "", prob_data$pathString)
    else if (j  > 1) prob_data[[paste0("parent",i)]] <- sub("/[^/]+$", "", prob_data[[paste0("parent",i)]])
  }
  
  prob_data <- prob_data %>% left_join(parent_lookup, by = paste0("parent",i))
  
}


prob_data$overall_prob <- apply(prob_data %>% select(contains("prob"))  , 1, prod, na.rm = T)  # calculate cumulative probability    
```


```{r}
terminal_data <- prob_data %>%  filter(tree_level == max_tree_level) %>% # create new rows that will display terminal/final step calulcations on the tree
  mutate(node_type = 'terminal',
         pathString = paste0(pathString, "/overall"),
         prob = NA,
         tree_level = max_tree_level + 1)

start_node <- "Sample" # name the root node

prob_data = bind_rows(prob_data, terminal_data) %>%  # bind everything together 
  mutate(pathString = paste0(start_node,"/",pathString),
         overall_prob = ifelse(node_type == 'terminal', overall_prob, NA),
         prob_rank = rank(-overall_prob, ties.method = "min", na.last = "keep"))

prob_data = bind_rows(prob_data, data.frame(pathString = start_node, node_type = 'start', tree_level = 0)) %>% # add one new row to serve as the start node label
  select(-contains("parent"))
```

```{r}
make_my_tree <- function(mydf, display_level = NULL, show_rank = FALSE, direction = "LR") {
  
  if (!is.null(display_level) ) {
    mydf <- mydf %>% filter(tree_level <= display_level)
    
  }
  
  mytree <- as.Node(mydf) 
  
  GetEdgeLabel <- function(node) switch(node$node_type, node$prob)
  
  GetNodeShape <- function(node) switch(node$node_type, start = "box", node_decision = "circle", terminal = "none")
  
  
  GetNodeLabel <- function(node) switch(node$node_type, 
                                        terminal = ifelse(show_rank  == TRUE, paste0("Prob: ", node$overall_prob,"\nRank: ", node$prob_rank),
                                                          paste0("Prob: ", node$overall_prob)),
                                        node$node_name)
  
  SetEdgeStyle(mytree, fontname = 'helvetica', label = GetEdgeLabel)
  
  SetNodeStyle(mytree, fontname = 'helvetica', label = GetNodeLabel, shape = GetNodeShape)
  
  SetGraphStyle(mytree, rankdir = direction) 
  
  plot(mytree)
  
}
```

```{r}
prob_data
```


### Execute the function to generate the tree diagram
```{r}
make_my_tree(prob_data, show_rank = TRUE)
```

## B) Solution:

### The probability that a passenger carrying a weapon will be detected is P(W) = P(A)* P(W|A) + P(B)* P(W|B) + P(C)* P(W|C)
```{r}
A*A_W + B*B_W + C*C_W
```

## C) Solution:
### If a weapon is detected on a passenger, the probability that Airline B detected it is P(B|W) = (P(W|B)* P(B))/ (P(A)* P(W|A) + P(B)* P(W|B) + P(C)* P(W|C))

```{r}
(B*B_W)/(A*A_W + B*B_W + C*C_W)
```


# Q-2

```{r}
# Mean
m = 185
# Standard deviation
s = 39
```

## A) Solution:
```{r}
# Let
X = 150
# So,
z = (X-m)/s
```

### The probability of young women in this age group will have cholesterol levels less than 150 mg/dl is
```{r}
pnorm(z)
```
### So the percent is 18.47%

## B) Solution:
```{r}
# Let 
X1 = 170
X2 = 200
# So,
z1 = (X1-m)/s
z2 = (X2-m)/s
```

### The probability of young women in this age group will have cholesterol levels between 170 mg/dl and 20 mg/dl is 
```{r}
pnorm(z2)- pnorm(z1)
```
### So the percent is 29.95%

## C) Solution:
```{r}
# Let
X = 190
# So,
z = (X-m)/s
```

### The probability of young women in this age group will have cholesterol levels greater than 190 mg/dl is
```{r}
1- pnorm(z)
```
### So the percent is 44.9%

# Q-3
## A) Solution:
```{r}
#Here
p = .2
q = 1-p
n = 10
#so mean
m = n*p
# And standard deviation
s = sqrt(n*p*q)
m
s
```

```{r}
# So for P(X<30)
X = 30
z = (X-m)/s
z
```

### the probability that a fewer than 30% of next 10 customers buy a packet of candy after using the free sample is
```{r}
# As m < 5, we can use binomial distribution
pbinom(X,n,p)
```



## B) Solution:
```{r}
#Here
p = .2
q = 1-p
n = 100
#so mean
m = n*p
# And standard deviation
s = sqrt(n*p*q)
m
s
```

```{r}
# So for P(X<30)
X = 30
z = (X-m)/s
z
```

### the probability that a fewer than 30% of next 100 customers buy a packet of candy after using the free sample is
```{r}
# As m > 5, we can use normal distribution
pnorm(z)
```

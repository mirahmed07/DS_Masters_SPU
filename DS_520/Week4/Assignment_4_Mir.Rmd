This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


# Problem 5.76
## Solution

```{r}
mu = 68
s = 22
n = 500
x = 70

z = (x-mu)/(s/sqrt(n))

# Probability of the average amount exceeding $70 is P(z>70) = 1-P(Z<70)

p = 1 - pnorm(z)
print(paste("Probability of the average amount exceeding $70 is", round(p,5)))

```

# Problem 5.82

## A) Solution:
### In a binomial setting with n trials and success probability p, the probability of exactly x successes is

### 𝑃(𝑋=𝑥)= (𝑛!/(𝑥!(𝑛−𝑥)!)) 𝑝^𝑥 * (1−𝑝)^(𝑛−𝑥)

```{r}
# Here
n = 12
x = 9
p = 3/4

ans = (factorial(n)/(factorial(x)*factorial(n-x)))*(p^x)*(1-p)^(n-x)
print(paste("The probability that exactly 9 out of 12 of these plants have red blossoms is",round(ans,4)))
```

## B) Solution:
### The mean number of red-blossomed plants when 120 plants of this type are grown from seeds red-blossomed plants is obtained below:
### The expected value of X can be obtained as follows:
### mu = n*p
```{r}
#Here
n = 120
p = 3/4
mu = n*p

print(paste("The mean number of red-blossomed plants when 120 plants of this type are grown from seeds red-blossomed plants is",mu))
```

## C) Solution:
### Standard deviation of sample 𝜎_𝑥=√(𝑛*𝑝(1−𝑝) )
```{r}
sx = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))
sx
```

### we know that Z = (X-mu)/sx
```{r}
# Here
X = 80
z = (X-mu)/sx
z
```

```{r}
# The probability of obtaining at least 80 red-blossomed plants when 120 plants are grown from seeds

print(paste("The probability of obtaining at least 80 red-blossomed plants when 120 plants are grown from seeds is",round(1- pnorm(z),5)))
```

# Problem 5.83

## Solution:
```{r}
# Here
mu = 66
s0 = 6
n = 12
# We know standard error s = mu/√n
s = s0/sqrt(n)
s
```

### Calculate the probability that the weight of a carton falls between 755 and 830.
*p(755<x<830)*
*=p(755/12<x<830/12)*

```{r}
# Here lower bound & upper bound
lb = 755
ub = 830
# Fit into normal distribution
lbn = lb/12
ubn = ub/12

z_lbn = (lbn-mu)/s
z_ubn = (ubn-mu)/s
print(paste("lower Z value",z_lbn))
print(paste("upper Z value",z_ubn))
```
### so the probability would be 
*P(-1.78016333000135 < Z < 1.82827585243382)*
*= P(Z< 1.82827585243382) - P(Z < -1.78016333000135) *

```{r}
pnorm(z_lbn)
```

```{r}
pnorm(z_ubn)
```

```{r}
print(paste("The probability that the weight of a carton falls between 755 and 830 is", round(pnorm(z_ubn) - pnorm(z_lbn),5)))
```
## Alternate solution:
```{r}
# Here
mu = 66
s0 = 6
n = 12

#lower bound & upper bound
lb = 755
ub = 830
# variance of the sum of 12 such random variable
v = n * (s0^2)
# standard deviation of the sum of 12 such random variables
s = sqrt(v)
# mean of the sum of 12 such random variables
n_mu = n*mu

z_lb = (lb-n_mu)/s
z_ub = (ub-n_mu)/s
print(paste("lower Z value",z_lb))
print(paste("upper Z value",z_ub))
```

```{r}
print(paste("The probability that the weight of a carton falls between 755 and 830 is", round(pnorm(z_ub) - pnorm(z_lb),5)))
```

# Problem 5.86

## A) Solution:
```{r}
# From given data N(32,6) for early-speaking group
mu_x = 32 # Mean of population as well as sample
s_x = 6 # Standard deviation of the population
n =25 # Sample size
# Standard deviation of the sample
s_x_n = s_x/sqrt(n)
s_x_n
```

```{r}
# From given data N(29,5) for delayed-speaking group
mu_y = 29 # Mean of population as well as sample
s_y = 5 # Standard deviation of the population
n =25 # Sample size
# Standard deviation of the sample
s_y_n = s_y/sqrt(n)
s_y_n
```

## B) Solution:

```{r}
# Difference of y and x between mean scores in the two groups from repeated experiments
mu_y_x = mu_y - mu_x
mu_y_x
```
```{r}
# Variance for early-speaking group
v_x_n = s_x_n ^2
# Variance for delayed-speaking group
v_y_n = s_y_n ^2

s_y_x =sqrt(v_x_n+v_y_n)
s_y_x
```

```{r}
print(paste0("So sampling distribution of the difference y¯−x¯ between the mean scores in the two groups from repeated expetiments is N(",mu_y_x,", ",round(s_y_x,5), ")"))
```

## C) Solution:

#### Now the probabilty of the mean score for delayed speaking is at least as large as that for early speaking
#### P(mu_y >= mu_x)
#### = P(mu_y_x >= 0)
#### = 1 - P(mu_y_x < 0)

```{r}
# Let new mean difference yx and probability of the misleading experiment is P

yx = 0

# As Z = (X-mean)/Std. deviation
Z= round(((yx- mu_y_x)/s_y_x),5)
Z
```

```{r}
P = round((1 - pnorm(Z)),5)
print(paste("the probabilty of the mean score for delayed speaking is at least as large as that for early speaking is",P))
```

# Problem 5.87

## A) Solution:

```{r}
# For female
# sample size for female
n_f = 400
# sample proportion for female (p^F)
p_f = .82
# Standard deviation for female
std_f = sqrt(p_f*(1-p_f)/n_f)
print(paste0("The approximate distribution of the proportion p^F of women who worked last summer is N(",p_f,", ",std_f, ")" ))
```

```{r}
# For male
# sample size for male
n_m = 400
# sample proportion for male (p^M)
p_m = .88
# Standard deviation for male
std_m = sqrt(p_m*(1-p_m)/n_m)
print(paste0("The approximate distribution of the proportion p^M of men who worked last summer is N(",p_m,", ",std_m, ")" ))
```

## B) Solution:

```{r}
# sample proportion for male and women comparison (p^M−p^F, mean)
p_m_f = round(p_m - p_f,2)
# Standard deviation for male and women comparison (√(variance of Male + variance of Female))
std_m_f = round(sqrt(std_m^2 + std_f^2),6)
print(paste0("The difference in the proportions who worked, p^M−p^F is N(",p_m_f,", ",std_m_f, ")" ))
```

## C) Solution:

### The probability that in the sample a higher proportion of women than men worked last summer would be
### P(p^F > p^M)
### = P(p^M−p^F < 0)
### = P(Z < (0-p_m_f)/std_m_f) as Z = (X-mean)/sd

```{r}
# So
Z = round((0-p_m_f)/std_m_f,4)
print(paste("The probability that in the sample a higher proportion of women than men worked last summer would be",round(pnorm(Z),6)))

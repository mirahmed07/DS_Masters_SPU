This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Teeth and military service
## A) Solution:
```{r}
# For recruits who were under 20
x1 = 68
n1 = 58952
p1 = round(x1/n1,6)
p1
```

```{r}
# For recruits who were at the age of 40 or over
x2 = 3801
n2 = 43786
p2 = round(x2/n2,6)
p2
```
## B) Solution:
```{r}
# Estimate for difference
p1-p2
```
```{r}
dat = data.frame(sample = c(1,2), x = c(x1,x2), n = c(n1,n2), P = c(p1,p2))
dat
```

```{r}
p_test = prop.test(x = c(x1,x2), n = c(n1,n2), alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = .99, correct = F)
p_test
```
```{r}
# As difference in population proportions is negative
# So Z-value
-unname(sqrt(p_test$statistic))
```
```{r}
# 99% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions
p_test$conf.int
```

```{r}
# mean / difference in population proportions
m = p1-p2
m
# Standard error of mean / difference
sd = sqrt((p1*(1-p1)/n1) + (p2*(1-p2)/n2))
sd
# pooled estimate
p = (p1*n1+p2*n2)/(n1+n2)
p
# Z-value
z = (p1-p2)/sqrt(p*(1-p)*(1/n1+1/n2))
z
```

## C) Solution:
*The null Hypothesis:*
H0: p1 = p2
*The alternate Hypothesis:*
H1: p1 ≠ p2
*Here p1 = Proportion of rejects for recruits who were under 20 and p2 = Proportion of rejects for recruits who were 40 or above*
```{r}
# P-value
pnorm(z,m,sd, lower.tail = T)
# Or
p_test$p.value
```

*As the p-value in this context is way less than 0.01, th null hypothesis is rejected at 1% level of significance.There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference between proportions of rejection among recruits who were under age of 20 and who were age of 40 or above. The result is statistically significant.*

## D) Solution:
#### The guidelines for using large sample method for a 99% confidence interval is that to check the below conditions for recruits who were under the age of 20 
#### n1*p1>=10 and n1*(1-p1)>=10
```{r}
n1*p1
n1*(1-p1)
```
*As both of them are greater than 10, we can say the guideline is satisfied.*

#### The guidelines for using large sample method for a 99% confidence interval is that to check the below conditions for recruits who were at the age of 40 or above 
#### n2*p2>=10 and n2*(1-p2)>=10
```{r}
n2*p2
n2*(1-p2)
```
*As both of them are greater than 10, we can say the guideline is satisfied.*


# 8.71
## Gender bias in textbooks
## A) Solution:
```{r}
# For female
n1 = 60 
x1 = 48
p1 = x1/n1
p1
se1 = sqrt(p1*(1-p1)/n1)
se1
```

```{r}
# For male
n2 = 132 
x2 = 52
p2 = x2/n2
p2
se2 = sqrt(p2*(1-p2)/n2)
se2
```

## B) Solution:
```{r}
# Estimate for difference
p1-p2
```

```{r}
# pooled estimate
p = (p1*n1+p2*n2)/(n1+n2)
p
```

```{r}
options(scipen = n)
p_test = prop.test(x = c(x1,x2), n = c(n1,n2), alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = .95, correct = F)
p_test
```

*So the P-value is 0.0000001785 and the difference in the two proportions is somewhere between 0.2749423 and 0.5371789 using 95% confidence intervals.*

## C) Solution:
*The null Hypothesis:*
H0: p1 = p2
*The alternate Hypothesis:*
H1: p1 ≠ p2
*Here p1 = Proportion of juvenile among female and p2 = Proportion of juvenile among male*
*Using level of significance a = .05, we can reject null hypothesis (H0) if z value from the difference in proportions is either less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96*
```{r}
# Z-value
unname(sqrt(p_test$statistic))
```
*Our Z-value is 5.220477. So we can reject H0. Also P-value was really low.*

*The test statistic value falls in the rejection region, so we reject the null hypothesis. There is a difference in the proportion of female juveniles and male juveniles.*


# 9.37
## Health care fraud
## A) Solution:
```{r}
#Here
n1 = 57
n2 = 17
n3 = 5
x1 = 6
x2 = 5
x3 = 1
dat = data.frame(Stratum = c("Small", "Medium", "Large"), "Numbers_Allowed" = c(n1-x1,n2-x2,n3-x3), "Numbers_not_allowed" = c(x1,x2,x3), Total = c(n1,n2,n3))
#, Total = c(n1,n2,n3)
dat
```

```{r}
dat <- rbind(dat, c("Total", colSums(dat[,2:4])))
dat
```

```{r}
#3 × 2 table of counts
dat = transform(dat,  Numbers_Allowed = as.numeric(Numbers_Allowed),Numbers_not_allowed = as.numeric(Numbers_not_allowed),Total = as.numeric(Total))
dat
```

## B) Solution:
```{r}
#the percent of claims that were not allowed in each of the three strata
dat$pct_not_allowed = round(dat$Numbers_not_allowed/dat$Total*100,2)
dat[1:3,c(1,5)]
```

## C) Solution:
*In a 3x2 table, the expected count corresponding to the cell (Large, Numbers_not_allowed) is less then 5. SO need to combine Medium and Large rows.*
```{r}
# Combining medium and large row
dat = subset(dat, select = -c(pct_not_allowed))
dat <- rbind(dat, c("Medium & Large", colSums(dat[2:3,2:4])))
dat = dat[-c(2,3),]
dat = transform(dat, Numbers_Allowed = as.numeric(Numbers_Allowed),Numbers_not_allowed = as.numeric(Numbers_not_allowed),Total = as.numeric(Total))
dat
```


```{r}
# reordering the rows
dat = dat[c(1,3,2),]
row.names(dat) <- NULL

dat
```

## D) Solution:
#### The null hypothesis:
*H0: There is no relationship between claims sizes and whether a claim is allowed.*
#### The alternate hypothesis:
*H0: There is a relationship between claims sizes and whether a claim is allowed.*

## E) Solution:

```{r}
row.names(dat)  = dat[,1]
dat = dat[,c(2,3,4)]
dat
```

```{r}
# Expected frequencies
xsq = chisq.test(dat[1:2,1:2], correct = F)
freq_df = data.frame(xsq$expected)
freq_df <- cbind(freq_df, Total = rowSums(freq_df))
freq_df <- rbind(freq_df, c(colSums(freq_df[,1:3])))
rownames(freq_df)[rownames(freq_df)==3]  = c("Total")
freq_df
```

```{r}
# expected frequency without totals
xsq$expected
```

```{r}
# Chi -square test statistics
xsq$statistic
```

```{r}
# Degree of freedom
xsq$parameter
```

```{r}
# P-value
xsq$p.value
```

```{r}
xsq
```

*The smallest P-value suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So we failed to reject the null hypothesis as p-value (.0634) is higher than 5 times in 100.*

## When do Canadian students enter private career colleges?
## A) Solution:
```{r}
file_name = "ex09-41canf.xls"
dat = read_xls(file_name)
dat
```

```{r}
after_df = filter(dat, Time == 'AfterHS')
after_df$after = after_df$n*after_df$Percent/100
after_df = after_df[c(2,5)]
after_df
```

```{r}
later_df = filter(dat, Time == 'Later')
later_df$later = later_df$n*later_df$Percent/100
later_df = later_df[c(2,5)]
later_df
```

```{r}
# 6x2 table with observed counts
main_df = merge(x = after_df, y = later_df, by = "Field", all = TRUE)
main_df <- cbind(main_df, Total = rowSums(main_df[2:3]))
main_df <- rbind(main_df, c("Total", colSums(main_df[2:4])))
main_df = transform(main_df, after = as.numeric(after),later = as.numeric(later),Total = as.numeric(Total))
row.names(main_df)  = main_df[,1]
main_df = main_df[,c(2,3,4)]
main_df
```

## B) Solution:
```{r}
# Total number of Canadian students surveyed
main_df[max(rownames(main_df)),max(colnames(main_df))]
```

```{r}
# The percentage of student enrolled right after high school is
paste0(round(main_df[max(rownames(main_df)),2]/main_df[max(rownames(main_df)),max(colnames(main_df))]*100,2),"%")
```

```{r}
# The percentage of student enrolled later is
paste0(round(main_df[max(rownames(main_df)),3]/main_df[max(rownames(main_df)),max(colnames(main_df))]*100,2),"%")
```

## C) Solution:
#### The null hypothesis:
*H0: There is no relationship between field of study and when a Canadian enrolls for a college.*
#### The alternate hypothesis:
*H0: There is a relationship between field of study and when a Canadian enrolls for a college.*

```{r}
# Expected frequencies
xsq = chisq.test(main_df[1:6,1:2], correct = F)
freq_df = data.frame(xsq$expected)
freq_df <- cbind(freq_df, Total = rowSums(freq_df))
freq_df <- rbind(freq_df, c(colSums(freq_df[,1:3])))
rownames(freq_df)[rownames(freq_df)==7]  = c("Total")
freq_df
```

```{r}
# Chi-square summary
xsq
```

*The smallest P-value suggests that we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.*

# 9.50
## Goodness of fit to a standard Normal distribution
## A) Solution:

```{r}
#With the given data
dat = data.frame(category = c(1,2,3,4,5), observed = c(139,102,41,78,140))
dat
```

```{r}
summary(dat)
```

```{r}
s = sd(dat$observed)
m = mean(dat$observed)
n = sum(dat[,2])
n
```

```{r}
# For first category, the probability of less than or equal to -0.6
p1 = pnorm(-.6,lower.tail = T)
# For second category, the probability of greater than -0.6 and less than or equal to -0.1
p2 = pnorm(-.1,lower.tail = T) - pnorm(-.6,lower.tail = T)
# For third category, the probability of greater than -0.1 and less than or equal to 0.1
p3 = pnorm(.1,lower.tail = T) - pnorm(-.1,lower.tail = T)
# For fourth category, the probability of greater than 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.6
p4 = pnorm(.6,lower.tail = T) - pnorm(.1,lower.tail = T)
# For fifth category, the probability of greater than 0.6
p5 = pnorm(.6,lower.tail = F)
```

```{r}
dat$expected = c(n*p1, n*p2, n*p3, n*p4, n*p5)
dat$"(o-E)^2" = (dat$observed-dat$expected)^2
dat$"(o-E)^2/E" = dat$`(o-E)^2`/dat$expected
dat
```

```{r}
# Chi-square value
chisq = sum(dat$`(o-E)^2/E`)
chisq
```

```{r}
# Degree of freedom (n-1)
d_f = length(dat)-1
d_f
```

```{r}
# P-value = P(X^2 >= 3.407)
pchisq(chisq, df=d_f, lower.tail=FALSE)
```
*The P-value > a = 0.05*
*Therefore, the test is not a good fit.*

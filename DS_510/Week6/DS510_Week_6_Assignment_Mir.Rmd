This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
#load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
```

# 1+2) Solution:
```{r}
# Importing the dataset into a dataframe
file_name = "simpledata.csv"
df = read.csv(file = file_name)
df
```

```{r}
# Scatterplot
plot(df$X, df$Y)
```

```{r}
#create plot with regression line, regression equation, and R-squared
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=X, y=Y)) +
        geom_smooth(method="lm") +
        geom_point() +
        stat_regline_equation(label.x=150, label.y=100) +
        stat_cor(aes(label=..rr.label..), label.x=150, label.y=90)
```

```{r}
# Dataframe summary
summary(df)
```

```{r}
# Dataframe structure
str(df)
```

```{r}
# Correlation
cor(df$X,df$Y)
```

*So the the variables have a strong, positive, linear relationship.*

```{r}
# Linear regression
fit<- lm(df$Y ~ df$X)
summary(fit)
```

```{r}
# Intercept and slope
a = unname(fit$coefficients[1])
b = unname(fit$coefficients[2])
paste0("Intercept = ",b)
paste0("Slope = ",a)
```

```{r}
# Linear Equation
paste0("y = ",round(a,2),"x + ",round(b,2))
```

# 3) Solution:
*The results are same but the calculations take a lot less time in R.*

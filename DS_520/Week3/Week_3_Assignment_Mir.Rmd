This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Problem 4.107

## A) Solution:
*Let A = 5 to 10 years old, B = 11 to 13 years old, C = adequate calcium intake, I = inadequate calcium intake.*

## B) Solution:
```{r}
# Probability of A = P(A)
A = .52
# Probability of B = P(B)
B =  .48
# Probability of A with inadequate calcium intake = P(I|A)
A_I = .18
# Probability of B with inadequate calcium intake = P(I|B)
B_I= .57
# Probability of A with adequate calcium intake = P(C|A)
A_C = 1-A_I
# Probability of B with adequate calcium intake = P(C|B)
B_C= 1-B_I

df = data.frame("pathString" = c("A", "B", "A/I", 'B/I', 'A/C', 'B/C'), "prob" = c(A,B,A_I,B_I,A_C,B_C))
df

```

## C) Solution:


### Script for generating tree diagram (Reference: https://datakwery.com/project/tree/):
```{r}
prob_data <- df %>%  mutate(tree_level = str_count(string = pathString, pattern = "/") + 1,
         tree_group = str_replace(string = pathString, pattern = "/.*", replacement = ""),
         node_type = "decision_node"
  )

```


```{r}
parent_lookup <- prob_data %>% distinct(pathString, prob) # get distinct probabilities to facilitate finding parent node probability

prob_data$overall_prob <- apply(prob_data %>% select(contains("prob"))  , 1, prod, na.rm = T)  # calculate cumulative probability    
```

  mutate(node_type = 'terminal',
         pathString = paste0(pathString, "/overall"),
         prob = NA,

*Here A = 5 to 10 years old, B = 11 to 13 years old, C = adequate calcium intake, I = inadequate calcium intake.*

# Problem 4.108

### Probability that a child has inadequate calcium intake = P(I) =P(A)*P(I|A)+P(B)*P(I|B)

```{r}
I = (A*A_I) + (B*B_I)
print(paste("P(I) =",I))
```

### Hence from bayes theorum, probability that a child from this population who has inadequate intake is 11 to 13 years old = P(B|I) 
###                                                                                                                         = P(B and I)/P(I) 
###                                                                                                                         = P(B)*P(I|B)/P(I) 


```{r}
BI = B * B_I/I
print(paste("P(B|I) =",BI))
```

# Problem 4.113
## Solution
### Let L = a student who admits of lying to a teach at least once
### M = A male student
### F = A female student

```{r}
# probability of L = P(L)
p_l = .48
# probability of M = P(M)
p_m = .5
# probability of F = P(F)
p_f = 1- p_m
# probability of P(L∩M)
p_lm = .25
# probability of P(L∩F)
p_lf = p_l-p_lm 
```

### The probability that a randomly selected student who is either male or would admit to lying to a teacher, during the past year would be 
### P(L or M) = P(L) + P(M) - P(L and M)

```{r}
print(paste("The probability that a randomly selected student who is either male or would admit to lying to a teacher, during the past year would be", p_l+p_m-p_lm))
```

# Problem 4.114
## Solution

### So, the probability that a selected student from the subpopulation of those who would admit to lying to a teacher and be female, during the past year would be 
### P(F|L) = P(L∩F)/P(L)
```{r}
print(paste("The probability that a selected student from the lying subpopulation is female, during the past year would be", round(p_lf/p_l,4)))
```
